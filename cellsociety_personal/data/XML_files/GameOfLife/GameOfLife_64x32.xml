        <title>Conway's Game of Life: 64x32</title>
        <author>John Horton Conway</author>
        <description> I expect to see the cells be created and destroyed in ways I cannot predict. This is an interesting example because it is the simulation that popularized Cellular Automata. We can view this simulation to get a general idea of how most others will function. </description>
